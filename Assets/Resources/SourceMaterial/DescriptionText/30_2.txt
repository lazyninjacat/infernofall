Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers. These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city; Sinon is here because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. 

Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide.
