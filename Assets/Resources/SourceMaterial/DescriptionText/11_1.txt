Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, you overhear Virgil explain to Dante the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished.

Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources, and human labor and activity. He explains that usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.
