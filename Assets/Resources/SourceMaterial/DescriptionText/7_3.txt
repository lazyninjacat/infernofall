In the swampy, stinking waters of the river Styx – the Fifth Circle – the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen lie beneath the water, withdrawn into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe. 

At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them.
