Here lie the Traitors to their Country: those who committed treason against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of one of these damned souls, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. 

The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole, one gnawing the nape of the other's neck.
