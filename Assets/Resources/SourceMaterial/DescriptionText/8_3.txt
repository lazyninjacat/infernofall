In the distance, you perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques. You overhear Virgil informing Dante that they are approaching the City of Dis. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls. 

You remember that Dis is one of the names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. You see that the walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels. You watch as Virgil attempts toconvince them to let Dante and him enter, but fails.
