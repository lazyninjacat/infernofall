The Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. You watch as Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the Minotaur. 

At the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. 

Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death, at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. You recall that the ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell, at the entrance to the second circle.
