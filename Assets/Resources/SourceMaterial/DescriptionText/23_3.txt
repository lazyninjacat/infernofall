Dante speaks with two Bolognese brothers of the Jovial Friars, an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree. One of the Friars points out the High Priest of Israel under Pontius Pilate, who counseled the Pharisees to crucify Jesus for the public good. He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes, and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him: he must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world's hypocrisy". 

The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit; Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the Sixth Bolgia.
