You have come upon the arch-Heretics, such as Epicurus and his followers (who say "the soul dies with the body") are trapped in flaming tombs.You watch as Dante speaks with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: a famous leader, and the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, Guido Cavalcanti. They appear to be discussing Florentine politics. 

In response to a question from Dante about the "prophecy" he has received, one of the damned souls explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when the portal of the future has been shut it will no longer be possible for them to know anything.
