You watch as Dante encounters Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Paris, Achilles, Tristan, and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life.
Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini, who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta; the two began to carry on an adulterous affair. They were killed when Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death.
