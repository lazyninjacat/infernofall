Here, you watch as Dante and Virgil observe fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about, hidden from view inside individual flames. These are not people who gave false advice, but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud. 

Ulysses and Diomedes are punished together within a great double-headed flame; they are condemned for the stratagem of the Trojan Horse - resulting in the Fall of Troy - for persuading Achilles to sail for Troy, and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas, the Palladium upon which the fate of Troy depended. 

Ulysses narrates the tale of his last voyage and death. He tells how, after his detainment by Circe, his love for neither his son, his father, nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to "gain experience of the world and of the vices and the worth of men".
