The second round of the seventh circle is the Wood of the Suicides, in which the souls of the people who attempted or committed suicide are transformed into gnarled, thorny trees and then fed upon by Harpies, hideous clawed birds with the faces of women; the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding. 

Dante breaks a twig off one of the trees and from the bleeding trunk hears the tale of one of the damned who, when living, fell out of favor with the king and was imprisoned, blinded, and subsequently committed suicide.
