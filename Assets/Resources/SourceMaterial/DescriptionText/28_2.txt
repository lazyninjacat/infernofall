The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch, their wounds healing in the course of the circuit, only to have the demon tear them apart anew. These are divided into three categories: (i) religious schism and discord, (ii) civil strife and political discord, and (iii) family disunion, or discord between kinsmen. Chief among the first category is Muhammad, the founder of Islam: his body is ripped from groin to chin, with his entrails hanging out. Here also is Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, who caused the schism between Sunni and Shiite: his face is cleft from top to bottom. 

In the second catergory there is a damned soul with his throat slit, nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows, and a wound where one of his ears had been. The Roman tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio who advised Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the Civil War, is here with his tongue cut off.
