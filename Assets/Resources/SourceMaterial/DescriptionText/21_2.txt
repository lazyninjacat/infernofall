The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of Lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him. Virgil secures safe-conduct from the leader of the Malebranche. He informs them that the bridge ahead is shattered as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ, but that there is another bridge further on. He sends a squad of demons led by Barbariccia to escort them safely.
