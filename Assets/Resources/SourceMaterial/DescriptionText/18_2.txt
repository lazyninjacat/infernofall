The panderers and seducersmake two files, one along either bank of the ditch, and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity. They deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests, are themselves driven and scourged"

In the group of seducers, Virgil points out Jason, the Greek hero who led the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece from AeÃ«tes, King of Colchis. He gained the help of the king's daughter, Medea, by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for Creusa. Jason had previously seduced Hypsipyle when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos on their way to Colchis, but abandoned her, alone and pregnant.
