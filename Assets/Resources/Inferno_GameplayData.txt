They appear to be discussing Florentine politics. 

In response to a question from Dante about the "prophecy" he has received, one of the damned souls explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when the portal of the future has been shut it will no longer be possible for them to know anything.

Description: 
Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, you overhear Virgil explain to Dante the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished.

Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources, and human labor and activity. He explains that usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.

At the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. 

Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death, at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. You recall that the ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell, at the entrance to the second circle.

The third round of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky. 

The Blasphemers (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the Sodomites (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the Usurers (the Violent against Art) crouch huddled and weeping. 

Dante finds Capaneus stretched out on the sands; for blasphemy against Jove, he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the Siege of Thebes; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife. The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the First Round, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second round) and crosses the Burning Plain. Virgil explains the origin of the rivers of Hell, which includes references to the Old Man of Crete.

17_1
Description: 
The Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.

The creature is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck.

18_2
Description:
The panderers and seducersmake two files, one along either bank of the ditch, and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity. They deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests, are themselves driven and scourged"

In the group of seducers, Virgil points out Jason, the Greek hero who led the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece from Aeëtes, King of Colchis. He gained the help of the king's daughter, Medea, by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for Creusa. Jason had previously seduced Hypsipyle when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos on their way to Colchis, but abandoned her, alone and pregnant.

19_1
Description:
You hear as Dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony, or the sale of ecclesiastic favors and offices, and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God. He shouts at the damned souls, 

"Rapacious ones, who take the things of God, that ought to be the brides of Righteousness, and make them fornicate for gold and silver! The time has come to let the trumpet sound for you."

The sinners are placed head-downwards in round, tube-like holes within the rock (debased mockeries of baptismal fonts), with flames burning the soles of their feet. The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt.

	Neutral: +1 Charity, -1 Prudence
	Bad: -1 Prudence



20_1
Description:
You watch as Dante looks down at the souls of fortune tellers, diviners, astrologers, and other false prophets. The punishment of those who attempted to usurp God's prerogative by prying into the future, is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies; in this horrible contortion of the human form, these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity, blinded by their own tears. 

Thus, those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves; they attempted to move themselves forward in time, so must they go backwards through all eternity; and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of God's law, so are their bodies distorted in Hell.

Dante weeps in pity, and Virgil rebukes him, saying, "Here pity only lives when it is dead; for who can be more impious than he who links God's judgment to passivity?"

23_2
Description:
Here you find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity, weighted down by leaden robes.

23_3
Description:
Dante speaks with two Bolognese brothers of the Jovial Friars, an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree. One of the Friars points out the High Priest of Israel under Pontius Pilate, who counseled the Pharisees to crucify Jesus for the public good. He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes, and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him: he must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world's hypocrisy". 

The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit; Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the Sixth Bolgia.

Description:
Dante and Virgil leave the bolgia of the Hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake, after which they cross the bridge of the Seventh Bolgia to the far side to observe the next chasm. The pit is filled with monstrous reptiles: the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards, who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs. 

The full horror of the thieves' punishment is revealed gradually: just as they stole other people's substance in life, their very identity becomes subject to theft here.[87] One sinner, who reluctantly identifies himself as Vanni Fucci, is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein, bursts into flames, and is re-formed from the ashes like a phoenix. Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante.

Vanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur Cacus arrives to punish the wretch; he has a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. 

Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. One in human form is merged with a six-legged serpent. Another figure first appears as a man, but exchanges forms and bites at another in the form of a four-footed serpent.

26_1
Description:
Here, you watch as Dante and Virgil observe fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about, hidden from view inside individual flames. These are not people who gave false advice, but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud. 

Ulysses and Diomedes are punished together within a great double-headed flame; they are condemned for the stratagem of the Trojan Horse - resulting in the Fall of Troy - for persuading Achilles to sail for Troy, and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas, the Palladium upon which the fate of Troy depended. 

Ulysses narrates the tale of his last voyage and death. He tells how, after his detainment by Circe, his love for neither his son, his father, nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to "gain experience of the world and of the vices and the worth of men".

Description:
In the Ninth Bolgia, the Sowers of Discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword; their bodies are divided as, in life, their sin was to tear apart what God had intended to be united; these are the sinners who are ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism.

28_2
Description:
The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch, their wounds healing in the course of the circuit, only to have the demon tear them apart anew. These are divided into three categories: (i) religious schism and discord, (ii) civil strife and political discord, and (iii) family disunion, or discord between kinsmen. Chief among the first category is Muhammad, the founder of Islam: his body is ripped from groin to chin, with his entrails hanging out. Here also is Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, who caused the schism between Sunni and Shiite: his face is cleft from top to bottom. 

In the second catergory there is a damned soul with his throat slit, nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows, and a wound where one of his ears had been. The Roman tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio who advised Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the Civil War, is here with his tongue cut off.

Description:
Finally, you come upon the third category of sinner of fraud. Dante sees Bertrand de Born. The knight carries around his severed head by its own hair, swinging it like a lantern. Bertrand is said to have caused a quarrel between Henry II of England and his son Prince Henry the Young King; his punishment in Hell is decapitation, since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body.

Description:
Suddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. 

Dante then encounters a damned soul that was a counterfeiter. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst.

Description:
Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers. These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city; Sinon is here because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. 

Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide.

Description:
Dante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge.

Description:
Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained.

11 ########## 9th Circle (Treachery)

32_1
Description:
At the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or "rounds") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, "The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice." 

This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers.

Description:

Description:
Here lie the Traitors to their Country: those who committed treason against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of one of these damned souls, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. 

The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole, one gnawing the nape of the other's neck.

Description:
The gnawing sinner tells his story: he is Count Ugolino, and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri. Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri to oust his nephew and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as his nephew was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower.

Description:
The third region of Cocytus is named after Ptolemy, who invited his father-in-law Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them. Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them.

33_3
Description:
Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, and had him cut to pieces. Branca did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. 

Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice.

The fourth division of Cocytus, named for Judas Iscariot, contains the Traitors to their Lords and benefactors. Upon entry into this round, Virgil says "Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni"  - "The banners of the King of Hell draw closer." 

Judecca is completely silent: all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice, distorted and twisted in every conceivable position. The sinners present an image of utter immobility: it is impossible to talk with any of them, so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell.

12 ########## Centre of Hell


34_1
Description:
In the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin - personal treachery against God - is the Devil. The arch-traitor, Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different color: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):

... he had three faces: one in front bloodred;
and then another two that, just above
  the midpoint of each shoulder, joined the first;
  and at the crown, all three were reattached;
the right looked somewhat yellow, somewhat white;
  the left in its appearance was like those
  who come from where the Nile, descending, flows.[104]

Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate. Lucifer has six wings, but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. 

Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar.

In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws.

34_2
Description:
Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the center of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb "upward" towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes, Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell.

34_3
Description:
Virgil explains how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the Mountain of Purgatory. 

This mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. 

The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above, moving in opposition to Lethe, the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. 

The poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday, beneath a sky studded with stars.


THE END!!!
